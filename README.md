# Prediction_Using_Decition_Tree_Algorithm
Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm involves using the decision tree model to make predictions based on input features. The algorithm builds a tree-like structure, where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, leading to different branches and ultimately predicting the outcome at the leaf nodes.
